    <h1>Happy Birthday!!! :) :) :)</h1>
    We have been through so much since this site was created.<br/>
    Thank you for always being there for me and helping me to see more clearly no matter how stressed out I am.<br/>
    Thank you for the smiles, the giggles, and the laughs.<br/>
    Thank you for always being yourself.<br/>
    <br/>
    I'm so excited to see how the world shifts with you in it. (Yay bebes!)<br/>
    I can't wait for another year filled with puns, references, and rolling up my sleeve very, very far.<br/>
    <br/>
    Happy bday!<br/>

    <h3>2019</h3>
    <h1>Happy Birthday Akanksha!</h1>
    <p>
        I hope you are having a <i>grape</i> birthday.<br/><br/>

        I consider myself super lucky to have met such a wonderful bean in my lifetime.<br/>
        You know how there are some people who light up a room when they walk into it? You tend to light up rooms just by being nearby.<br/>
        I love your strength and resilience and how hard you work to make the world better (despite whatever "debatable" grudges people may hold).<br/>
        Keep on being your amazing self.<br/><br/>

        I hope your next year is filled with lots of laughter, good times, and fantastic hooman conversations.<br/><br/>

        - London :)<br/><br/>
